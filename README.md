## My first ever website

This website is my first web development project ever. 
Following the Udemy tutorial I learned how to make a basic html/css website, and after that I remade it again as the 
Star Wars fan page website, adding my own design. At this point I knew only the basics, but i think it was a nice start of my journey.
