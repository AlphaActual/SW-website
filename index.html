                                    <p>The phrase "I have a bad feeling about this" or "I have a very bad feeling about this" is said in every Star Wars movie.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        In a story development session for Return of the Jedi, George Lucas toyed with the idea that after Luke removes dying Vader's helmet, he puts it on, proclaims "Now I am Vader" and turns to the dark side.

                                    <p>Chewbacca's voice is a mix of bears, walruses, lions, badgers and other dying animals.</p>
                                    <p>The sets for The Phantom Menace were only as tall as the actors, but they didn't account for 6'4" Liam Neeson. They had to rebuild all the door frames for Qui-Gon Jinn, which racked up an additional  in production costs.</p>

                        <h2>Welcome visitor!</h2>
                        
                        <p>You have arrived on the Star Wars Fanpage 1.1. May the force be with you! :D This is my first website ever. It is written completely in HTML and CSS with no javaScript involved, so maybe it does look a little static, but I have plans to upgrade it in the future and add some animation and other cool stuff to make it look nice.  <s>It is not yet mobile friendly so it doesn't like resizing that much :) but this is the very next thing I will commit to making.</s>It is now in v1.1. Try resizing it now! Force is strong with this one !&#128513 </p>

                        <p>Please keep in mind that it was made with the sole purpose of learning how to do it (and to convert you to a become a fan mmmwwwwahahahahaha), rather than emphasizing content.</p>

                        <p>It was made following a really cool <a href="https://www.udemy.com/html-and-css-for-beginners-crash-course-learn-fast-easy/">Udemy tutorial</a> made by a really cool guy<a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/edwin166/"> Edwin Diaz</a>, but I decided to make my own twist and make a Star Wars website out of it.(because yeah I'm a ner...khm huge fan of Star Wars.)If you are starting to learn about web and websites I recommend you try his tutorials and lectures and you will learn a lot in no time.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>I hope you enjoy your stay and find it pleasing to the eye and that it inspires you to try this yourself because it is really fun to do. </p>

                        <p>And to wrap it up if you haven't watched the movies yet,then what are you doing with your life? Seriously :| Go and watch them now! And of course in order that their Creator invisioned them to be watched - IV, V, VI- I, II, III, VII, VIII Some fans TRIGGERED in 3..2..1. <br> </p>
